This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the dependecies:-
```
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### You will see two Tables, one is created Using [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and the other is created using [EvergreenUI](https://evergreen.segment.com/). Both of them are very usefull in terms of quick component creation. 

### A local [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) is also running on [http://localhost:3003/data](http://localhost:3003/data), so you can see the data.
